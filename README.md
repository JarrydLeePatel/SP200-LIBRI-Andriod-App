```
As a company, the software that we will develop will be aimed at students and lectures of
universities and colleges that do not have the money to pay for very expensive, brand new
books or users that have finished their studies and wish to sell their books to other
students. The industry that the project is aimed at is secondary and tertiary education. In
2017, the total number of students that enrolled in public universities was estimated to be 1
043 102 and 193 962 of these students started for the first time their education in
undergraduate (Africa Check, 2017).

### System proposal

### Overview.....................................................................................................................................................

#### Overview

#### Background of the company:

Libri is an online marketplace that allows users to buy and sell both new and old
textbooks, currently in developments by Hominibus Software Development (HSD). HSD
aims to develop an efficient way to trade textbooks online through its minimalist design via
an android mobile application. The app offers easy navigation for the user to efficiently buy
and sell their second-hand textbooks. The interface’s simplistic and minimalistic approach
allows any user to understand the concepts needed to buy and sell their textbooks using
the mobile application. Libri also provides an alternative and reliable way to for students to
acquire second hand textbooks without the expenses of purchasing brand new textbooks
at a retailer.

Background of the company’s customer
Libri is mainly targeted at university and potentially high school students, but Libri is not
necessarily limited to a student audience. Any user seeking to sell their old textbooks or
buy a second-hand textbook would be a potential customer. However, the app will only be
available to android users as it will be primarily developed in android studio.


#### Problems opportunities relating to the current system:

Problems that the system will face is that our company has no budget. We will also be
developing in waterfall which means we cannot go back to any phase. We will be
developing in Android which means a piece of our market will not be able to use the
system.
Hominibus Software Development has identified a gap in the market as there is currently
no platform for student to buy and sell their textbook online. Libri offers several features
that are aimed at providing high quality service and reliable transactions, making the
application truly unique. Graduates and current students generally struggle to find a way to
efficiently sell their textbooks for a reasonable price and similarly student often struggle to
source and purchase textbooks at the lowest price. Many students are also forced to
purchase new textbooks every year because they simply are unable to find senior students
with the second-hand textbooks they require. Libri aims to rid students of textbooks they no
longer require and return some of their initial investment while affording other students the
opportunity compare prices and quality of textbooks and purchase textbooks at a lower
cost.
The extremely high prices in new textbooks are becoming a national problem as these
textbooks are simply not affordable to the average student (Nkosi, 2014). Hominibus
has identified that developing the application with no budget, using the waterfall model
and only on an android platform will result in the following problems:
No modules in our program can be outsourced.
If a mistake is made in any of our previous deliverables we cannot go back and correct it. A
large portion of the market will not be able to use the application.

#### Possible solutions for the current problems or opportunities:

- No budget - the system will need to be developed fully in-house.
- All work will need to be carefully analysed before submission. Our emphasis will be on
planning and analysis to ensure our project will be feasibly before design and
development.
- The loss of IOS users is minimal compared to the gains of Android because there are
more Android than IOS users in South Africa (McKane, 2018). The app may be ported over
to IOS and other operating systems at a later stage to capitalise on the full market.

#### Recommendations

After conducting a detailed feasibility study on the options that are available for developing the
software, Hominibus software has concluded that the best course of action to take is to develop the
software in-house instead of outsourcing to another organization. The recommendation above is
made in order to produce a product that our target market and clients can use to satisfying their
needs.

Furthermore, we recommend that the software is developed for the latest version of Android
Operating System. The reason for this, is that the majority of the South African market are Android
users and we do not have the time and resources required to expand the product. Hominibus does
however recommend that the software can be expanded to other platforms in the future.

### Methodology

```
The Waterfall model
```
The waterfall model is comprised out of phases which must each be finished off before work on the
next phase of development can begin (Sharma, 2016). Furthermore, this methodology is regularly
called the 'traditional' or 'Cascade development approach'.
The Waterfall model consists of six phases:

#### 1. Planning 4. Development

#### 2. Analysis 5. Implementation

#### 3. Design 6. Review and closure

Planning stage begins when an issue is distinguished and referenced. The reason for this stage is
to affirm that an issue exists and to distinguish the defence for the undertaking. This choice is come
to by the utilization of three limitations:

#### • Technical

#### • Time

#### • Budget

In the event that it was chosen that the task will proceed, the Analysis stage is begun. This can take
a day or two, up to a couple of months, contingent upon the undertaking size and degree of the
issue or opportunity.
The Design stage incorporates planning the UI configuration screens, which ought to be tried with
the clients to guarantee that they favour the look and feel of the framework.
The following stage is the Development stage, in which coding is completed and equipment is
acquired.
Implementation is the following stage, where any equipment that has been obtained is conveyed;
gained programming is introduced, the framework is introduced and preparing is given to the end-
clients.
The project is then finished and enters the Review and Conclusion stage.


### User requirements document

#### Introduction

User requirements are critical to any project in development. User requirement documents should
explain the purpose and scope of system. Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations are needed for
developers to communicate with customers and stakeholders. URD’s allow customers and
stakeholders to check that the system does what they intend to use the system for. URD’s are
simple and often in natural language with not much technical details. An example would be that the
software must allow users to trade textbooks using a mobile application and allow users to access
the database which will store textbooks and process transactions.

#### Purpose

The product that we will be developing is a mobile application which will allow users to sell and buy
textbooks. The purpose of this is to provide students, learners and lecturers with an easy method of
selling their old books that they no longer and allowing them to buy books that they do in fact need.
The books that will be traded on our platform will be 2nd hand books from students and lecturers.

This document is aimed at fellow developers and supervisors to precisely describe the user
requirements of our system and allow everyone to be working in a coordinated fashion. This
document can also be aimed at the users of the system to verify that we are on the right track with
delivering the system that they want.

#### Scope

Our system is called Libri. This system will provide an online, mobile platform that can be used by
students and lecturers to sell second hand textbooks. Sellers and buyers can be students or
lecturers. The user must be able to sign up or login to our platform to use our services. The
following functions are included in the scope of our system:

#### • Users can login or sign up to purchase, sell, view, search for, and review adverts posted by

```
other users.
```
#### • The system will include a third-party delivery service to allow users to have goods delivered

```
to them.
```
#### • Security will definitely be included in our scope as our users have to be able to make secure

```
payments and trust our platform with their information.
```
Our system has the following benefits:

#### • It can be developed with software that are free and open source which provides us with a

```
wide range of tools that we can use to develop our system.
```
#### • There is a demand for an easier, cheaper and more reliable way for students to buy and sell

```
textbooks in a secure manner.
```
The main goal of our system is to provide users with old textbooks a reliable way of selling these
textbooks to users who might need them more. Textbooks are extremely expensive and if we can
allow these users to at least get some of the money that they paid for those textbooks; we will be
helping them a lot.

Another goal of our system is to allow other users who can’t afford to pay for new textbooks every
year to pay a lot less and be able to find textbooks that are of an acceptable quality.


### Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations

#### Abbreviations:

#### Acronyms:

UI – user interface
URD – user requirement documentation
DBMS – database management system

#### Definitions:

- Database management system – is a system software that help creating, editing and managing
    databases.

### Overview

As discussed above user requirements are vital to the development of a project however, it is
important that we have system requirements. System requirements are written for developers, this
would include detailed functional and non-functional requirements. System requirements are more
specific and clearer compared to user requirements. System requirements are instructions which
give the developers direction to understand what they will need to do to design and accomplish a
successful project (Tech Terms, 2019)

### System requirements

#### System perspective

Our system is not a stand-alone system as it is comprised of multiple sub systems some of which
are created and managed from third-party developers. Our system is comprised of the following
systems:

#### • A Database Management System: Our system is related to this system through all of our

```
data. The DBMS will be responsible for the safe keeping and management of all the
data that runs through our platform. Databases are managed and maintained by
systems known as Database Management Systems (Mullins & Christiansen, 2019).
```
#### • Delivery System: This system will be used by our system to prevent users from being

```
limited to only buying and selling items that they can organize transport for to get the
product.
```
Our system interacts with these other systems to allow it to safely store information that is required
for the system to function and to expand the product options that are available to users. Users are
also not limited by their location and mobility as the delivery system will allow them to have products
collected/brought right to their front door.

#### An entity relationship diagram (ERD)

An Entity Relationship Diagram (also referred to as an ERD) is a graphical representation of the
relationships that exist between different entities within an information system (Biscobing & Aberle,
2018).


### Non-functional requirements

We’ve identified the following non-functional requirements for our system (Roux, et al., 2019):

#### • Human-computer interactions or user interfaces: (Rose, 2016).

#### o All user interfaces should be easy to use and intuitive to enhance learnability

#### o All buttons, text, font, spacing and colours should be as uniform as possible to enhance

```
learnability.
```
#### • Security requirements:

```
o Each user should have their own secure account login
o All databases must be secured with passwords
o Only administration staff should have access to databases
```
#### o Users should only be able to view and update their own profiles and sales info

#### • Communications interfaces

```
o Buyers and sellers should be able to efficiently communicate through the Libri.
```
#### o All users should be able to contact administrators through the help function

#### • Hardware and software interfaces

```
o Libri should run on Android smartphones/ mobile devices
```
#### • Other performance requirements: speed; maintainability, reliability, robustness, flexibility, etc.

#### o Libri should be as efficient as possible when updating any information, sending

```
messages, etc.
```
#### o Libri should be relatively easy to maintain and tested thoroughly to ensure there are no

```
issues once released.
```
#### o Libri should be developed in such a way that is reliable (secure and data should

```
maintain integrity), flexible (an object-oriented approach will ensure objects can be
changed as needed) and robust (an object-oriented approach will ensure errors are
isolated and can be resolved more efficiently)
```
#### • Other performance requirements: speed; maintainability, reliability, robustness, flexibility, etc.

### Technical requirements

#### • Android Studio

#### • MYSQL

#### • A system to program on, for example: a laptop or pc

#### • Server to store database information


### User characteristics

#### • Moderately capable of using technology

### Information systems design........................................................................................................................

### Physical design

Logical Design refers to a graphical representation of a system showing the system's processes and
the flows of data into and out of the processes (Hirata & Yamaoka, 2013). Logical design is more
conceptual and abstract and does not focus on physical implementation, but instead the types of
data required and how data will flow in the system. To represent the logical design of a system we
can use different diagrams such as, Entity-Relationship Diagrams or Data Flow Diagrams (Coudert,
2001).

#### Figure SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 4: Level 0 DFD continued

#### Figure 3 Level 1 DFD continued


Figure 5: Level 2 DFD


### Physical design

Physical design deals with how input data is provided, how the input is processed and how the data
is displayed. The Physical Design relates to the actual input and output processes of the system, as
well as the technologies used during these processes (Coudert, 2001).
The physical design can generally be broken down into three sub-tasks:
● User Interface Design
● Data Design
● Process Design

#### Investigation of technologies to be applied

The operating system that is required for our program to run will be Android. The version we will be
using is Android 6.1, Marshmallow. As a result, only mobile phones and other devices with the
Android operating system using this version or higher can use our app. Due to time constraints, this
operating system will be the only type that can access and use our app to its full potential.

The programming languages we are using are Java and XML. Java will be used to code most of the
backend and front end of the app. XML will be used to design the UI of the app.

The program itself will be created on Android Studio which has both programming languages
integrated into its system. This allows for easy coding and testing as Android Studio has emulators,
and allows the app to be tested on a real mobile phone.

Our database will be cloud-based and for this reason we will be using Firebase as our main
database. This will allow the database to be run 24/7 and doesn’t require one of our members to
constantly monitor it. It is also free to use and can be integrated into the actual program while having
other useful functionalities to assist in a smoother program.

### Testing templates

Testing is a part of the development lifecycle in which the program is executed and checked for
errors. There are many different types of tests that are used to make sure a program is running
optimally.

Software testing assist in key factors when creating a program, such as budget, security, and
product quality (Edureka, 2019).

#### Types of testing:

There are two main types of testing, functional and non-functional (Hackr.io Blog, 2019). These
types are further divided into different subtypes of testing as listed below:

Functional Testing -focuses on whether or not your program is giving the desired results. To do
this, each and every function of the program is tested (Hackr.io Blog, 2019).

These are the most common subtypes of functional testing:

Unit Testing- This type of test focuses on the smallest part of the software. Units that are related or
grouped are tested by receiving sample input. The outputs are checked if any loops, method or
function is not working properly (GeeksforGeeks, 2019). Since the code is relatively small, only the
most recent changes need to be debugged to find any problems if the code was working fine before
(Edureka, 2019).
This is the easiest and fastest method of testing (Atlassian, 2019).

Integration Testing- Units that have already been tested are combined in order to produce an
output. This verifies that different modules work well together (Atlassian, 2019).


Regression Testing- This type of testing ensures that even after a new component is added to the
program, the program will still work efficiently and effectively. The entire system is tested again in
this type of testing (GeeksforGeeks, 2019).

Smoke Testing- This testing phase ensures that the program has not burnt out in previous test
phases and is stable for more testing (GeeksforGeeks, 2019). They are meant to be quick and give
assurance that all major parts of the program is working as expected (Atlassian, 2019). This is done
by a series of tests that are meant to exercise the core functions of the program (Tutorial et al.,
2019).

Alpha Testing- QA team members test the program thoroughly to look for all issues and errors. This
is done before the product is released to the customers (GeeksforGeeks, 2019).

Beta Testing- This is done by the end-users of the product but only to a limited amount of people
(GeeksforGeeks, 2019) Some changes can be made after criticism is received from the users
(Hackr.io Blog, 2019).

System Testing- The program is tested on whether it performs fine on a different operating system.
This focuses mainly on inputs and outputs (GeeksforGeeks, 2019).

User Interface Testing- Test the UI of the program to check whether or not it has followed the
requirements of the users. This is also done to make the UI more user friendly and easier on the
eyes (Hackr.io Blog, 2019).

Black Box Testing- This test is done by the QA of a company in which they do not know the
technical side of the program, such as coding, logic, internal structure (Hackr.io Blog, 2019). The
tests are based on the functions and requirements of the program (Guru99.com, 2019).

White Box Testing- This test is done by the development team and requires great knowledge about
the code, its logic, and internal structure (Hackr.io Blog, 2019). This test covers code statements,
branches, pathways, and conditions of the program (Guru99.com, 2019).

Non-functional testing checks how reliable the program is by testing performance, security,
usability, and so on (Hackr.io Blog, 2019). While functional tests allow you to better your program,
non-functional acts as a polish for your program. This means that it focuses entirely on how well the
program runs (Hackr.io Blog, 2019).

These are the different types of non-functional testing:

Performance Testing- This testing done to check on the run-time performance of the program. The
speed and effectiveness of the program is tested (GeeksforGeeks, 2019).

Stress Testing- The program is put into an unfavourable condition to test how it would perform
under these conditions. This is used to check the reliability and stability of the program (Atlassian,
2019).

Security Testing- These are done to check whether security breaches can be prevented. Any
security issues that are found can be changed and strengthened to increase the programs security
(Hackr.io Blog, 2019). This can be done by mimicking an intruder penetrating the system via use of
malicious programs or brute force (Basics et al., 2019).

Usability Testing- The user-friendliness of the app is tested which checks how easily a user can
use the app without getting stuck or lost. This can be done by allowing random people to use the
app without receiving any help (Hackr.io Blog, 2019). The extra perspective from an outside source
is usually helpful when looking to improve the user experience (Software Testing Fundamentals,
2019).

Scalability Testing- This tests whether your app will be able to scale if the number of users, data, or
transactions increases (Hackr.io Blog, 2019). It focuses on the program as a whole to see how much


extra workload the program can actually manage when it experiences an influx of users, data, or
transactions (Basics et al., 2019).

Reliability Testing- This type of testing checks whether a user can run the program error-free and
without data loss (Hackr.io Blog, 2019).

Recovery Testing- This checks whether the program can recover from a crash and how well it can
recover from a crash. This is done to make sure that the program can recover quickly to avoid
upsetting users (Hackr.io Blog, 2019). To do this, a major crash or failure is mimicked and the
program is observed in order to report and fix any problems (Agarwal, 2019).

### System interface design

```
Login User Registration
```
Login UI details:

The login page is where a user is able to log onto
the system with a username or email address
and password using the login button.

Not registered yet button will lead a user into the
next page to perform the registration.

```
User Registration UI details:
```
```
The registration page is actually where the user
fills in all his/her details that will be stored in the
database.
```
```
The confirm button in the user registration page
will check if all the data in each field is not
empty or null.
```

```
Home
Initial Search
```
Home page UI details:

The home page allows a user to select if a user
wants to buy or sell a textbook.

The buy button will lead the user to the page
where it can select textbooks or search for it.

The sell button will lead the user to the Create ad
page.

The menu button displays a drop down for easy
navigation to other pages (Messages, Profile or
report an incident) and allows the user to log out.

```
Initial UI details:
```
```
The Initial search page is displayed after a user
clicks buy from the home page. The user can
search for adverts for their desired textbook by
selecting what they would like to search by
using the drop down menu and then inputting
the relative information in the search field.
```
```
The layout has been altered from the initial
design:
```
```
The by dropdown has moved below the search
field and the search button now uses a
magnifying glass icon.
```

```
Main Search View Ad
```
Main Search UI details:

The Main Search function displays the ads
searched for in the initial search page in a
scrollable window. Users are able to select and
view ads from this page.

The design has been altered:

Users are able to search on the main search
page as well. The filter by button has been
reduced to a simple plus button with a dropdown
menu which allows users to sort the ads rather
than filter them. Ads are also displayed as cards
rather than in tabular form.

```
View ad UI details:
```
```
The user is able to view the textbook ad on its
own and add the item to their cart. The user
can also contact the seller (this will open the
sellers profile page).
```

```
Cart Report Incident
```
Cart UI details:

- Selecting an item from the cart will take the user
to the ad page
- Touching the X on the right of the item will
remove it from the cart
- Tapping the checkout button will proceed the
user to the invoice page
- The cart remained the same during
development

```
Report Incident UI details:
```
```
The report incident User Interface allows a user
to log an issue. The UI has two steps. First step
the user must select the type of incident which
has occurred from a dropdown menu. Second
step the user will need to write a brief
description on the issue. Once both steps are
completed the user clicks the submit button.
The issue will be logged into the Libri teams
Database which can then be viewed by an
administrator.
```

```
View User Profile Message Function
```
View user UI details:

The user profile page (public view) that is
displayed above is a snapshot of what the user
will see when viewing another user’s profile. This
view allows one user to see relevant contact
details as well as other useful information about
another user. That user’s ads can also be viewed
along with a button which takes the user to the
messaging system.

Changes made:

•We have decided to no longer include a user
profile pic as it is unnecessary and most users
wouldn’t bother to upload one anyways.

```
Message Function UI details:
```
```
The Message function is a simple yet efficient
User interface which allows users to
communicate (one-on-one) via a chat system.
Users can share details and get in touch about
any queries.
```

```
View Personal Profile
Create an ad
```
Personal profile page UI details:

In this view, the user is able to view and edit his
own data that he entered when registering. This
page is important in the event that a user’s
information changes and needs to be updated.

Changes made:

•We are no longer doing profile pictures.

```
Create an ad UI details:
```
```
The create an ad page is displayed after a user
selects sell on the homepage. It allows the user
to fill in all of the necessary fields and add a
picture and then post the ad.
```
```
The following changes have been made:
```
```
The user cannot ad more than one book to an
advert. The image is displayed on this page.
The condition of the book will be selected from
a dropdown menu.
```

### Evaluation report

#### Introduction

This document aims to evaluate our software system that we have developed over the past few
months and some key aspects of the project. Firstly, we’ll have a look at the final system and
compare it to the original requirements that we identified earlier on in the project to see how
things changed. Then, we’ll be looking at how we as a group performed by having a look at the
group dynamics and the collaboration that took place throughout the project.

Finally, we’ll be covering how time management went throughout the whole project and during
each phase of development before we look at all the lessons, we as a group learned from this
ambitious project.

### The final system and the customer’s requirements

The final system meets all of its functional system requirements:

```
Code Priority Functional Requirements Requirement met: Y/N
```
```
H2 High User registration Y
H3 High User Login Y
```
```
M6 Medium Changing user details Y
H1 High Creating, posting and deleting
ads
```
##### Y

```
M1 Medium Search function Y
```
```
M2 Medium Sort Function Y
M7 Medium Cart subsystem Y
H4 High Order Processing subsystem Y
```
```
M3 Medium Receipt function Y
M4 Medium Invoicing function Y
```
```
L1 Low Purchase history Y
L2 Low Help function Y
```
```
M5 Medium Messaging function Y
```

The final system also meets all of its system non-functional requirements:

#### • Human-computer interactions (user interfaces) o All user interfaces should be easy to use

```
and intuitive to enhance learnability o All buttons, text, font, spacing and colours should be as
uniform as possible to enhance learnability.
```
#### • Security requirements

#### o Each user should have their own secure account login o All databases must be

```
secured with passwords o Only administration staff should have access to
databases
```
#### o Users should only be able to view and update their own profiles and sales info

#### • Communications interfaces

#### o Buyers and sellers should be able to efficiently communicate through the Libri.

#### o All users should be able to contact administrators through the help function

#### • Hardware and software interfaces o Libri should run on Android smartphones/ mobile

```
devices
```
#### • Other performance requirements: speed; maintainability, reliability, robustness, flexibility, etc.

#### o Libri should be as efficient as possible when updating any information, sending

```
messages, etc. o Libri should be relatively easy to maintain and tested thoroughly to
ensure there are no issues once released. o Libri should be developed in such a
way that is reliable (secure and data should maintain integrity), flexible (an object-
oriented approach will ensure objects can be changed as needed) and robust (an
object-oriented approach will ensure errors are isolated and can be resolved more
efficiently)
```
#### • Other performance requirements: speed; maintainability, reliability, robustness, flexibility, etc.

The system meets most of the user’s final requirements however the system concept and scope
of the project changed, resulting in some of the initial requirements being omitted such as:

#### • A return function was not included as the logistics behind it would not be practical. The user

```
would be able to log an issue or contact the seller prior to purchasing the textbook to ensure
that it is the correct book and the book is in the condition stated in the advert.
```
#### • It is unnecessary to capture the user’s ID no. or credit details because payment is handled in

```
an external system, such as PayPal or Payfast.
```
#### • A cash on delivery system would not be as reliable as online payments, therefore cash on

```
delivery was not considered while developing the system.
```

### Group dynamics and team collaboration..................................................................................................

Jarryd:
The group had its moments. It would be illogical to believe that the group would be perfect.
Therefore, I cannot complain about my group. We faced challenges that I saw coming from the
get-go. In a group it is common that certain people would have certain strengths over other
people. In the group we had strong programmers, and people that struggle with programming,
therefore there was difficulty for those who could program as they had to program an application
with a vast scope and a strict deadline. Communication in the group was decent, we had a group
chat which we would communicate over. Overall, I’m glad I got the opportunity to work with my
group as I took away a lot from this experience with them.

Gabriel
Our communication started off well but as our academic load increased we stopped having
regular meeting and only communicated when necessary.
Unfortunately, many of our group members struggled to complete their assigned functions and
did not tell the team that they were struggling with certain things until it was too late. Work had to
be reallocated to team members that had completed their work on time (this was done far too
late because we were unaware that certain team members were struggling or unable to complete
their code). The team members that took on this work became extremely frustrated because it
was during a heavy academic period. There was also very little communication between team
members that picked up the work and those that hadn’t completed the work.

Amiena
Our project group had great collaboration and team communication. Everyone was always aware
of what was expected and what needed to be done. There was hardly any conflict amongst
group members, and any conflict would be quickly resolved through team communication. There
were no ill feelings amongst any members.

Hugh-Martin
Our team started off very strong. For the first half of the project everything went great.
Communication was good, we had fixed schedules for when things were due and these
schedules were implemented and closely followed. There was no real conflict in those early
months and collaboration was spot on and thanks to this, we flew through the first 3 deliverables
really quickly and effectively.
Deliverable 4 is where things started going wrong. Communication broke down to a large extent
and instead of coming together as a group, we split up and tackled individual tasks without
effective communication. Group members that struggled didn’t come forward right away and a lot
of time was wasted by myself and other group members by not starting work during the holidays.
All of this contributed to a lot of issues when integration time came and progress basically
stopped. Individual sections weren’t completed on time and we were put behind schedule.
Despite Gabriel’s best efforts to get the wheel turning even though he was no longer group
leader, it took a while before my sections, Amiena’s sections and Danilson’s sections were
finished. Although I managed to finish my sections, Gabriel and Jarryd had to basically redo
Amiena and Danilson’s sections while still having to deal with integration issues.
When our sections were finished, they often rarely worked as a result of poor communication and
lack of experience and research. It eventually came down to Jarryd and Gabriel having to fix
other people’s code very close to due dates which raised tension in the group.


```
Ideally, we should have made use of a version control system like Github in order to avoid the
massive integration problems that we faced and that meant two members had to do integration
of all 5 parts. It would have also made testing and error correction much easier to do without
further splitting the system. I also believed that combined with the use of a version control
system, our group should have had more JAD sessions instead of individual parts as I believe
this might have helped Amiena and Danilson to learn the system much faster and have led to
fewer integration issues as everyone would have been aware of how each other’s sections fit in
to the system.
```
```
Danilson
The group Hominibus is open to new challenges, the intention is to show how important it is to
start new cycles and encourage the group to be more motivated and confident to face new
projects, come up with new ideas and achieve new goals as well. The group Hominibus still need
an overall improvement of team performance, with members more engaged and aware of their
skills and importance in achieving the goals.
```
### Time management

```
Jarryd:
During the project I understood how important time management was to the success of the
project. What worked well was the allocation of work, we allocated work to each other well, we
had a decent system from sharing and connecting the pieces of work together however, we as a
group did not always have perfect time management and thus did affect our overall scope. What
I would suggest for future improvements would be to extensively identify strengths and weakness
of group members to help with allocation of work in order to speed up the process, as wells as
setting deadlines 2-3 days earlier instead of last minute, this would lead to better time
management.
```
```
Gabriel
Our time management started off very well. We had a schedule and everyone knew what needed
to done and when things were due. After returning from the midyear break our schedule stopped
working because deadlines were no longer being met and we were forced to constantly push
back deadlines. Unfortunately, by the time we had to start integration we were already running 2
weeks behind schedule which put a lot of pressure on the team.
I think that if we had consistently checked up on how far everyone was with their work (at least
weekly) throughout the holiday period and thereafter and found ways to reallocate work if
deadlines could not be met earlier, we would not have ended up 2 weeks behind schedule.
```
```
Amiena:
Time management has mixed feelings involved. Some members struggled with the time given
and scope that needed to be finished. If it could be improved on, I think making the scope
smaller would have been the ideal choice. If the scope could not be shortened, then starting as
early as possible would’ve have been the next best choice.
```
```
Hugh-Martin
Time management was for the most part very good throughout the project. During the planning
phases we had schedules designed and we stuck to them. There were however two time
management factors that were also contributing factors to the later problems that we faced.
```

Firstly, the fact that most of the group myself included didn’t start working on the system until
basically the start of semester 2. Secondly, the delay in finishing up individual projects and not
keeping to deadlines put us two weeks behind schedule and left us with not nearly enough time
for integration.

Danilson:
The group Hominibus had a rough time during the project but with all the effort the team handled
the schedule and will finish the project in time.

### Lessons learnt

Jarryd:
Overall Software project was an interesting journey with many lessons learnt along the way. One
of the most interesting lessons learnt was using an API in the message function which I created.
I now understand the importance of Objects and data structures to create effect code. During
The process of coding the message function I learnt how to create models and fragments to
improve my code. My favourite part of the project was learning xml in order to create layouts.
During the project I learnt a lot about group work. During the project I learnt to understand that
each member in my group has a different personality, each member also had certain strengths. I
now understand that when approaching a project like this again it is important to identify who in
the group has certain strengths in order to avoid issues during the project.

Gabriel:
Throughout this project I was surprised to learn how much effort actually goes into a software
development project. I learnt the importance of validating your scope and making sure that the
project you embark upon is realistic.
I realised far too late the importance of using a platform like github which is specifically design to
collaborate on IT projects. It was also extremely challenging for me to adapt and understand that
everyone works at their own pace. I tried my best to not put too much pressure on my
teammates because I was very concerned about being labelled as a slave driver and have my
teammates reluctant to work with me in the future. At the beginning of our project I had
absolutely no experience with android studio and firebase and I found it enthralling and exciting
to figure things out, solve problems and learn new concepts and methods to do things from
Youtube videos. Throughout the project I know I’ve gotten just a taste of what android app
development is like and it has built up my confidence as a programmer and increased my
interest in programming in general.

Amiena:
I learnt about what an actual software development project feels like. It can be stressful but also
a really good learning opportunity. Building a full application can feel very rewarding. Learning a
whole new system was a new experience that was difficult but also enjoyable. Working within a
group also taught me how to listen with understanding, how to get your point across, and how to
communicate well amongst each other. It also showed how important working together was and
how knowing what everyone was doing provided a benefit to the group.
Hugh-Martin:
This project taught me a lot of very useful skills and lessons, some of which I had to learn the
hard way in many cases. These include:


#### • Greatly improved my coding skills: This project gave me a chance to experience a really

```
good simulation of what programming in the real world might be like.
```
#### • Proper Planning: We got a chance to see how planning influences the overall project.

#### • Scope Management: This project showed me personally how important it is to make sure

```
that the project scope is reasonable and achievable with the time and skills available.
```
#### • The importance of VCS: Never again will I undertake a practical group project of this size

```
without making great use of a version control system as it just makes everything flow so
much faster and improves collaboration.
```
Danilson:
Danilson Pucuta is my name and I am Hominibus group member and the main lessons I learned
during our project are that I could notice some improvement opportunities to be implemented and
that could contribute to our project. However, there are still opportunities for improvement to be
worked out by the team. This project was very important to my knowledge and skills because
allow me to improve and understand how to do better research, selection, organization and
communication of information.

### Conclusion

This document documented the user and systems requirements and then allowed each group
member to discuss and evaluate the project as a whole.

Overall, we as a group can agree that this was an enormous project which had a lot of issues but
we conclude that the project was a success. Everyone is in agreement that as a group we should
have had better time management during the 2nd half of the project and that we should have
been more careful at the start of the project with our scope management.

Everyone learned a lot of lessons from this project and as a group, were we to take on a project
of similar scope in the same amount of time, we would definitely perform better as we would not
make the same mistakes.
